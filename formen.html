<b>Exercise - 1 : Press-up<br>
<img src="images\1.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Get down into a press-up position with your hands placed shoulder-width apart and back flat, so a straight line forms from your head to heels, via your glutes. Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then explosively drive up by fully extending your arms. That's on rep.
<br>
<b>Why?</b><br>
This move uses multiple muscle groups for maximum growth and strengthens your shoulder joints. This prepares you for progression to the more demanding shoulder exercises you'll face in a gym, like the incline bench press.<br>
<br>

<b>Exercise - 2 : Dumbbell squat<br>
<img src="images\2.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Holding a dumbbell in each hand, position your legs shoulder width apart. Keeping your head up and back straight, sit back into the squat until the dumbbells are an inch from the floor. Focus on keeping your knees over your toes and chest out – don't arch your back or lean forward as you drop down. Exhale, straighten your legs and return to the starting position.<br>
<b>Why</b><br>
Squats are an excellent all-round exercise and one of the best moves for building overall strength. Dumbbells let you concentrate on technique and work on your range of movement at low weight. Only advance to barbell squats in the gym once you've got this nailed.
<br><br>

<b>Exercise - 3 : Lateral raise<br>
<img src="images\3.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Stand holding a light dumbbell in each hand. Slowly lift the dumbbells out to the side until they reach shoulder height – no higher – and resist the urge to cheat by swinging the weight. Pause, then lower back to your sides, slowly – you'll build more muscle fighting gravity than letting it do the work for you.
<br><b>
Why?</b>
This is the best exercise for visible shoulder development. The lateral raise isolates your medial deltoid, the middle of three shoulder muscles, helping to develop your shoulder width and mass. Perfect for creating the V-shape you covet.<br>
<br><b>

Exercise - 4 : Bicep curl<br>
<img src="images\4.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Stand with a dumbbell in each hand and, keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the weights until the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Focus on keeping your elbows still – only your lower arm should move. Squeeze your bicep at the top of the contraction then lower slowly and repeat.
<br><b>
Why?</b><br>
This is the perfect move for developing those mirror muscles you crave. By keeping your upper arm stationary you hit the whole bicep for maximum growth.<br><br><b>

Exercise - 5 : Plank<br>
<img src="images\5.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Get in a press-up position, but rest on your forearms rather than your hands. Make sure your back is straight and tense your abs and glutes. Hold without allowing your hips to sag.<b><br>
Why?</b><br>
Endless crunches put pressure on your spine and, when done incorrectly, can give you a set of weird, distended abs. Planks are perfect for working your core in a way that keeps you injury-free and builds the flat six-pack you're after.
<br><br><b>

Exercise - 6 : Deadbug<br>
<img src="images\6.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Lie on your back with hands above you and feet up so your knees are at 90 degrees. Straighten your leg until your heel is an inch from the floor and then return to the start position. Repeat with the other leg.<br><b>
Why?</b><br>
By extending your legs and hovering your heels you work on your core stabilisers, not just your abs. That means you're building muscle you can use on the sports field, not just see in the mirror.
<br><br><b>

Exercise - 7 : Dumbbell floor press<br>
<img src="images\7.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Lie down on the floor with a dumbbell in each hand. Bend at the elbows and hold the weights above you. Press up and straighten your arms before pausing at the top of the rep and lowering slowly to the start position. <br><b>
Why?</b><br>
By restricting your range of movement this moves helps you build a bigger chest, minus the risk of shoulder injury from over extension. Consider this your stepping stone to being a bench bro in the gym.
<br><br><b>

Exercise - 8 : Dumbbell standing shoulder press<br>
<img src="images\8.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Stand holding two dumbbells at shoulder height with an overhand grip – palms facing forwards. Ensure your elbows are in front of the bar and don't flare out to the sides. Press the weights up above your head until your arms are fully extended. Return slowly to the start position.<br><b>
Why?</b><br>
This is a safer shoulder-sculptor than lifting from behind your neck. As a beginner the aim should be to keep strain off your joints and protect against an injury called shoulder impingement syndrome. Missed sessions this early in your lifting career are especially costly.
<br><br><b>

Exercise - 9 : Farmer’s walk<br>
<img src="images\9.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Grab a heavy dumbbell in each hand – think half your bodyweight – and hold them at your sides. Stand up tall with your shoulders back and walk forward as quickly as you can using short steps.<br><b>
Why?</b><br>
Super simple with no need to worry about technique, this move hits your shoulder stabilisers, upper traps and front deltoids. It also supercharges your grip strength, which will transfer strength to your other lifts too.
<br><br><b>

Exercise - 10 : Side plank<br>
<img src="images\10.gif" width="200px" height="200px" style="float:right"></img>
How to</b><br>
Lie on your left side with your legs straight and prop yourself onto your elbow. Brace your core and raise your hips until your body forms a straight line. Hold this position while breathing deeply. Roll over and repeat on the other side.<br><b>
Why?</b><br>
Excellent for targeting a small muscle in your lower back, the quadratus lumborum. Strengthening it is crucial for spine health and will help you avoid the notorious beginner's back pain. Diamond-cut obliques are a bonus.
